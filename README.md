- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fireoxya
- 👀 I’m interested in all things computery. Website design, app design, tech and tech aesthetics are all things that interest me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic HTML, CSS & eventually other coding languages like JavaScript, React, Python but will continue to focus on the fundamentals for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is for the "betterment of mankind". Whether that be simple stat apps to help people reach their goals or even 
- designing a website to get someones business up and running, but I'm pretty much down for anything.
- 📫 How to reach me:
- fireoxya@outlook.com

Website / Portfolio still to come.
